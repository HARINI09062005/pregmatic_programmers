# Adobe India Hackathon 2025: Connecting the Dots
## A Note of Gratitude
To the entire team at Adobe,

Thank you for this incredible opportunity to participate in the Adobe India Hackathon 2025: Connecting the Dots. It has been a truly rewarding and intellectually stimulating experience.

The theme of this hackathon, "Rethink Reading. Rediscover Knowledge," is both inspiring and deeply relevant in today's information-rich world. The challenges pushed us to think creatively about the future of digital documents and to transform the humble PDF into an intelligent, interactive, and context-aware companion.


We wholeheartedly agree that in a world flooded with content, it is 

context that wins. This principle was at the core of our approach to both challenges.


### Round 1A: 
Understand Your Document was a fantastic foundational challenge. Building a system to extract structured outlines from raw PDFs taught us immense respect for the complexity of document architecture and the power of creating a structured, machine-readable format from unstructured data.




### Round 1B: 
Persona-Driven Document Intelligence was a brilliant next step. The task of extracting and prioritizing information based on a user's persona and their "job-to-be-done" is a powerful concept that gets to the heart of what modern AI should do: provide relevant, personalized, and actionable insights. Crafting a solution to serve diverse personas—from a PhD Researcher to an Investment Analyst—was a fascinating and deeply engaging problem to solve.





We are proud of the solutions we have built and are grateful for the clear guidelines, constraints, and scoring criteria, which made the objectives clear and the development process focused.




Thank you once again for the platform to learn, innovate, and contribute to the future of how we read, learn, and connect. We look forward to the possibility of future engagements.

Sincerely,
